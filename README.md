# Advent of Code 2023

My work for the 2023 [Advent of Code competition.](https://adventofcode.com) My completion times and finishing places are listed below.  

It should be noted that the code here represents my attempts to code as fast as possible. The lack of commenting and the butchering of some data structures is a reflection of my attempts at speedcoding, not how I generally develop.
